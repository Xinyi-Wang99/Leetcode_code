# Question Description;
# You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
# Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
# Return the head of the merged linked list.

# Other people solution;
# 1. iterate those two linked list and store them in a new one 
#    Time complexity: O(m+n)    Space complexity: O(m+n)
# 2. Recursive
#    if not l1 or not l2:
#       return l1 or l2         // if one of them is null return another one
