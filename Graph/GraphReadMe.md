# Graph

# Knowledge about Graph:

1. A Graph consists of a set of vertices and set of edges, which might have dirrection might not. <br/>
        *If the edges have direction, then we called directed graph. Otherwise, we call them as undirected graph*

2. In and Out degree

3. An acyclic graph is a graph having no graph cycles. (DAG -- directed acyclic graph)

# Well Known Algorithm:
1. **Dijkstra's algorithm** <br/>
    Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
